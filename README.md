This is not meant to serve as a validator of a Bitbucket Pipelines YAML.
It may be possible that this application can execute a structure that Bitbucket Pipelines cannot.
If there is a structure that Bitbucket Pipelins *can* execute, and this application cannot, please create an issue for this.

This program requires sh to run. Please ensure that your used Docker images includes sh, as the program will not function correctly without it.
